#### Control structures (called "actions" in template parlance) provide you, the template author, with the ability to control the flow of a template's generation. Helm's template language provides the following control structures:

* **if/else for creating conditional blocks**
* **with to specify a scope**
* **range, which provides a "for each"-style loop**
