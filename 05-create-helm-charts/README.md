## Creating Helm Charts 

- **as we now understood that a `Helm Chart` is collection of `kubernetes manifest yaml files` put it into pre defined directory structure**

- **we can create/develop these chart by using**
   * ***regular kubernetes manifest yaml files placed into the chart directory structure as they are***
   * **`OR`**
   * ***we can also templatize these yaml files to pass values dynamically by using `helm template language`***
