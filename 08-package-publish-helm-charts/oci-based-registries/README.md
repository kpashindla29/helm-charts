## Helm repositories in OCI-based registries

> **A Helm repository is a way to house and distribute packaged Helm charts.** 

> **An OCI-based registry can contain zero or more Helm repositories and each of those repositories can contain zero or more packaged Helm charts.**

### [HELM-OCI-based-registires](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/)

## Use hosted registries

> **There are several hosted container registries with OCI support that you can use for your Helm charts. For example:**

* ***Amazon ECR***
* ***Azure Container Registry***
* ***Docker Hub***
* ***Google Artifact Registry***
* ***IBM Cloud Container Registry***
* ***JFrog Artifactory***
